         <div class="intro-text">
            <p>Hello. I am Miguel Zapata, an aspiring Software Developer from the University of Minnesota with deep interest in both hardware and software. I’ve was fascinated by how computers work on the inside. My hands on experience with deceive by taking apart old devices, doing repairs, and understanding the engineering behind the technology has led my to explore computer engineering then later computer science.
My journey to graduation isn’t always been straightforward. I didn’t immediately click with computer science as I struggled at first, but overtime I found my place in areas where software and hardware overlap.  I enjoy troubleshooting, using tools like terminals and debuggers, and finding ways to build programs that can run smoothly even on limited hardware. I am a first-generation college graduate after being a commuter student for years. And all of that shapes in the way I learn, work, and collaborate. </p>

      Intrests
  </h1>

  <p>Each of these passions contributes to my creative, technical, and personal growth. Here's a deeper dive into what I love about them.</p>
    <div class="interest-list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Public Transit</strong>
          <p> I rely on public transit every day, and overtime, it’s something that I enjoy. I like to explore different parts of the city often going off the usual paths just to see what’s out there. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Travel</strong>
          <p>Traveling has always been part of my life. Sometimes to reconnect, other times to move though new or familiar places. I tend to travel light and say observant, often picking up on things others pass by.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Football (Soccer)</strong>
          <p>The sport connects me with culture and community. I follow matches from around the world, and I’m fascinated by the history behind clubs and countries. It’s both relaxing and inspiring.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Engineering/Computers</strong>
          <p>As a CS major, I’m passionate about software and hardware. I value open-source technology for its freedom and accessibility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Video Games</strong>
          <p>Growing up, video games spark my early interest in problem solving design. Even now I still find inspirations in games’s handle systems, feedback, and user experience. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Photography</strong>
          <p>Allows me to capture moments and to express my perspective. From Smartphone or DSLR, I like to document my surroundings..</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hardware Repair & Tinkering</strong>
          <p>Taking devices apart, fixing them, or understanding how they work has always grounded my interest in tech. I enjoy the challenge and satisfaction of getting things working again.</p>
